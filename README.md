# documentation
Space for drafts, notes and resources around serendipity and search in digital design collections.


## Guide

 - an attempt to map out the information contained in [digital collections](./collections.md), going from abstract types of information to more concrete aspects and how they relate to search and potentially to serendipity
 
 - primers on the different ways [algorithmic search](./algorithmic_search.md) can be implemented on the different types of information contained in digital collections
 
 - finally, there's a [glossary](./glossary.md) of terms and concepts spread in the other documents or generally of relevance to this project  -- if anything is missing according to you, please feel free to leave a note and I'll add a description
 
---

 - draft of a proposal for the [technical tasks](./technical_tasks_draft.md) in this projects. the proposal is concerned mainly with those tasks deemed necessary regardless of specific desired outcomes, such as obtaining, interpreting and processing data  
 


## Disclaimers

 - as much as we may think so: the information contained in and attached to an object always stays the information that is available on that object, algorithms can be used to extract, structure or process that information but they cannot add to it (except by guessing)
 
  - context: we can add to the information contained in an object record by combining, connecting and comparing the record with and to information from other sources, e.g. other records from the same collection or other data such as the internet (Wikipedia and the like), and thereby _contextualising_ that record
