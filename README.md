# documentation
Space for drafts, notes and resources around serendipity and search in digital design collections.


## Guide

 - an attempt to map out the information contained in [digital collections](./collections.md), going from abstract types of information to more concrete aspects and how they relate to search and potentially to serendipity
 
 - primers on the different ways [algorithmic search](./algorithmic_search.md) can be implemented on the different types of information contained in digital collections
 
 - finally, there's a [glossary](./glossary.md) of terms and concepts spread in the other documents or generally of relevance to this project  -- if anything is missing according to you, please feel free to leave a note and I'll add a description
