# Glossary

the definitions in this glossary are not meant to be normative or authoritative (and not necessarily equal to standard definitions) but only reflect who we interpret and use the listed concepts in the context of serendipitous search. the point of these definitions is thus also to foster discussion and make disagreements visible. therefore, if you notice any differences with your own conceptualisations, please make changes or leave a note with the glossary entry. this glossary is also by no means exhaustive, so if you find any terms missing, please add them (you can also leave a note asking to define the term).

## Digital Collections

 - **collections**: collections are acrhives, typically of cultural objects, and the two terms are often used interchangeably but their relationship is somewhat vague. as such, collections inherit the (very modern) notion that _everything is an archive_ which explicitly rejects that only institutional archives can be archives. note that archives are 'fractal' in nature -- subsets of archives or even of the information in them are also archives themselves -- which is a property that is especially useful in computational contexts

 - **objects**: the primary 'things' in a collection are objects, especially in digital collections also referred to as _records_ and _points_ when the collection is seen as data. objects may be material (vases, posters, etc) or immaterial (stories, theories, software, etc); these categories may overlap (e.g. in the case of printed yet born-digital images)
 
 
 - **meta-data**: information _about_ objects contained in a collection and what primarily what makes the collection an _archive_. its functions are both to provide context for objects (such as their history or intended use) and to organise them (through categories and technical information). thus, meta-data typically contains information about objects that is not contained in the objects themselves (e.g. their visual or auditory representation) and creates implicit or explicit associations between objects. in these ways, meta-data facilitates search
 
 - **makers**: author, creator, etc of an object are used interchangeably and as aliases of the person, collective, entity that _made_ the object, its maker(s). _maker_ is often preferred in contentious (e.g. colonial) contexts as it does not commit to notions of creativity, authorship, etc and only assumes that an object was made with an intention (whatever that intention may have been)

 
## Search

 - **embedding spaces**:
 - **algorithms** & **heuristics**: can be understood as parametised strategies or recipes
 - **categorical search**
 - **keyword search**
 - **semantic search**
 - **knowledge graph**
 - **entity recognition**
 - **object recognition**
 - **keyword extraction**
 - **categorisation**
 - **information extraction**
 - 

## Serendipity

 - **complexity**
 - **randomness**: same as chance; not to be confused with chaos and not be understood as equality of chances (rigged dice that are biased towards one side are still random)
