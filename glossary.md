# Glossary

the definitions in this glossary are not meant to be normative or authoritative (and not necessarily equal to standard definitions) but only reflect who we interpret and use the listed concepts in the context of serendipitous search. the point of these definitions is thus also to foster discussion and make disagreements visible. therefore, if you notice any differences with your own conceptualisations, please make changes or leave a note with the glossary entry. this glossary is also by no means exhaustive, so if you find any terms missing, please add them (you can also leave a note asking to define the term).

## Digital Collections

 - **objects**: the primary objects in a collections are objects, especially in digital collections also referred to as _records_ and _points_ when the collection is seen as data. objects may be material (vases, posters, etc) or immaterial (stories, theories, software, etc); these categories may overlap (e.g. in the case of printed yet born-digital images)
 
 - **maker**: author, creator, etc of an object are used interchangeably and as aliases of the person, collective, entity that _made_ the object, it maker(s). 

 
 - **meta-data**: information _about_ objects contained in a collection and what primarily what makes the collection an _archive_. its functions are both to provide context for objects (such as their history or intended use) and to organise them (through categories and technical information). thus, meta-data typically contains information about objects that is not contained in the objects themselves (e.g. their visual or auditory representation) and creates implicit or explicit associations between objects. in these ways, meta-data facilitates search
