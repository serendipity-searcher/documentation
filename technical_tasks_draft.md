# Technical Tasks
---

Proposal for technical tasks to be done in preparation for production of the _Serendipity Searcher_ project.



## Getting Data

 - establish communitaction with digital collection managers at the involved archival institutions:  
    - [*MKG Hamburg*](https://www.mkg-hamburg.de/)
    - [*Worker's Cultural Home, Trbolvje*](https://architectuul.com/architecture/workers-cultural-home-trbovlje)
    - *Slovenia National Archives*
    - [*Design Museum Ghent*](https://www.designmuseumgent.be/)
    - more?

 - familiarising ourselves with the relevant APIs  
   - though there are standards, there are several & archival institutions often don't follow them (fully)  
     notable exception: Design Museum Ghent, which has a SPARQL endpoint and uses the CIDOC-CRM ontology (according to them)
     --> we will likely have to spend time 
     
 - deciding which aspects of each collection are relevant  
   - this point will be part of a feedback loop together with [*unifying data*](#Unifying-Data) and   
   - often underestimated: this can take time as a technical challenge

## Processing Data


## Unifying Data



## Interpretation: Getting to know the Data

the project itself has a empirical side to it: we let the data -- the ways in which cultural heritage is digitally kept at museums -- inform how we interact with it in the project and how we define and design serendipitous search; this implies that we will want to spend time 'getting to know the data' and important get to know it _without narrowly defined questions in mind_

 - this part spans all the other tasks as well as being a task on its own
 - it can include visualising and summarising parts of the data, in order to facilitate discussions internally and at workshops 


## Documenting?

 - is it useful/necessary/desirable to archival institutions/our team/the public to create 'formal' (i.e. publishable) documentation of our process?  
   -> might this be part of potential installations? are there educational aspects to this project?  
   -> may be especially necessary/relevant if we want to include participatory aspects in the project

# Variables and Risks

---

## Variables

aspects of the technical side of this project that will likely only reveal themselves when we get there:

 - are the involved archival institutions technically ready to share their data? are they able to put in effort to assist us?
 - is there enough data? i.e. do collections consist of enough archival records to support the digital techniques we envision?  
   even if they collections are large, is there enough *parseable* and *usable* information?
 - can the different collections be unified at all? i.e. does the information they contain individually have large enough semantic overlap?
 -   


## Risks



miscellaneous experiences I have made with working on digital collections (of heritage):

 - institutions and the documentation they provide might *claim* that their data is in a certain state, follows certain standards and contains certain information but the reality might differ  
   - e.g. certain fields of records may indeed contain values but these values may be largely devoid of actual information  
   -> the associated risk is that we develop our concept around certain properties of the collections that are not present in practice
