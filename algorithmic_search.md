# Search Algorithms


## Preliminaries

### collections and connections within them:

 - collections are finite subsets of a part of a society's culture and, to go even further, incomplete representations of society's knowledge; the connections and associations between objects present in a collection are therefore equally finite and incomplete

 - as much as we may think so: the information contained in and attached to an object always stays the information that is available on that object, algorithms can be used to extract, structure or process that information but they cannot add to it (except by guessing)

 - context: we can add to the information contained in an object record by combining, connecting and comparing the record with and to information from other sources, e.g. other records from the same collection or other data such as the internet (Wikipedia and the like), and thereby contextualising that record
 
### orderings

 - search can be framed as placing orderings over a collection -- a given search, with all of its contexts and parameters, reorders the objects in a collection from most relevant to least relevant (and then typically a cut-off on the number of relevant objects leads to a search result)
 
 - a bit of math: for a collection of $n$ objects, there are $n!$ (_read: [n factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial)_)
